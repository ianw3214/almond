Some sort of ~~strategy~~ city-building game I guess (I need to make up my mind)

To make SDL2 work on windows, [follow the instructions here](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2#windows-msvc)

## Some sort of TODOs

- [ ] Buildings
- [ ] map generation (tiles)
- [ ] UI system
  - [ ] load UI from json file (maybe? investigate)
- [ ] Tech trees
- [ ] Resource manager
- [ ] Delta time management
- [ ] testing????
